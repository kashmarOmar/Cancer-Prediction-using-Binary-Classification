#Cancer-Prediction-using-Binary-Classification
This Machine learning project for Cancer Prediction

#Abstract: 
This report presents the results of a project focused on predicting the occurrence of cancer using binary classification techniques. The primary objective was to develop accurate models that could classify patients into two classes: those with cancer and those without cancer. The study employed various classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, to achieve this goal. The report discusses the dataset, methodology, model selection, evaluation metrics, and the results obtained.
#Intro
Cancer is a complex and devastating disease that requires early detection and diagnosis for effective treatment. Predictive modeling using machine learning techniques offers the potential to assist medical professionals in identifying potential cases of cancer, enabling earlier interventions and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to explore the applicability of binary classification algorithms to predict the presence of cancer based on relevant medical features.

#Final Results:
Line [39]Accuracy for Random forest: from the table :0.97
[40]Accuracy for SVC : from the table :0.97.
[41]Accuracy for XGBoost: from the table :0.98.
[44]Executed Hyperparameter Tuning using GridsearchCV resulting in a maximum of 99% =0.99 accuracy by the XGBoost.

#Conclusion:
The results demonstrate that the chosen classification algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and XGBoost, all achieved high accuracy and strong performance in predicting cancer cases. These models hold promise in aiding medical professionals in early cancer detection, which can significantly impact patient outcomes and treatment strategies. Further research could explore the integration of additional features and optimization of model hyperparameters.
